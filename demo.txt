slider\nby alligator
welcome to slider
a simple slideshow creator
here's how it works
a slideshow is a text file
one line is one slide
slider reads this\nand turns it into a PDF
long lines of text automatically wrap
or you can\nput newlines\nin slides\nusing \\n\nif you want
lines starting with # are ignored
it supports formatting options
! ! is monospace
< < is left aligned
- - is small
<-you can\ncombine them\ntoo
<!-combining all three works well for code\n\nif (thing) {\n  printf("hello\\n");\n}
it has some command line arguments
 -d is dark mode
you're seeing dark mode right now
-dark mode = white on black\n\nlight mode = black on white\n(this is the default)
 -4 is 4:3 mode
this outputs slides in a 4:3 aspect ratio
in case you're presenting on a projector from 2002
slider is designed to be simple
-simple = less decisions\n\n\n\n
-simple = less decisions\n\nless decisions = focus\n\n
-simple = less decisions\n\nless decisions = focus\n\nfocus = good presentations
